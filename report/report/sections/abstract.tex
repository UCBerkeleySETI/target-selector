One of the flagship missions for the Breakthrough Listen (BL) project is conducting the most comprehensive radio-frequency search for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by observing one million nearby stars. The MeerKAT radio telescope, a precursor to the Square Kilometer Array, will allow BL to pull data streams from primary observations and commensally observe one million stars in the Southern Hemisphere. To organize these observations, we present the MeerKAT Target Selector, a component of the BL commensal survey pipeline to select targets within the field of view of primary observations and rank them based on set criteria. We also present a simulated observational analysis of the one million high-quality targets selected from the Gaia Data Release 2, which will form the basis for further refinement of our target ranking algorithm. Finally, we compare the expected results of our survey to past ETI surveys using modest parameter estimates of the instrument.
